# Background

Jesse’s foray into data science started with a statistics class in graduate school, where she was first introduced to R. Although her academic career as a molecular biologist didn’t quite pan out, she found herself using data science to inform both her teaching methods and curriculum development as a high school science teacher in NYC. Having moved out of a traditional classroom and into the non-profit space, she continues to combine her passion for public education with her love for data science (and R!) in creative and impactful ways.

Jesse is a cohort 10 member of the [Harvard Strategic Data Project program](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/), a [Datanaut](open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/), and serves on the [GSNETX](http://www.gsnetx.org/) STEM Advisory Board.
