# Background

Jesse’s foray into data science started with a statistics class in graduate school, where she was first introduced to R. Although her academic career as a molecular biologist didn’t quite pan out, she found herself using data science to inform both her teaching methods and curriculum development as a high school science teacher in NYC. While she’s no longer in a traditional classroom, she continues to combine her passion for public education with her love for data science (and R!) in creative and impactful ways.

Jesse is also the community manager for the R for Data Science Online Learning Community, as well as a co-founder of RLadies Dallas.
