title: "R4DS Online Learning Community: improvements to self-taught data science and the critical need for diversity, equity, and inclusion in data science education"
---
The first iteration of the R4DS Online Learning Community was created as an online space for learners and mentors to gather and work throughthe "R for Data Science" text in a collaborative and supportive environment. The creation of this group was inspired by my own success in transitioning to a career in data science coupled with the resources that I wanted to see in the R programming space. This talk will go through the learnings of creating an online learning space focused on R programming for data science, and how futureiterations of similar groups can more proactively center on bringing about diversity, equity, and inclusion to data science spaces.
