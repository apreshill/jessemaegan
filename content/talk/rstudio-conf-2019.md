The first iteration of the R4DS Online Learning Community was 
created as an online space for learners and mentors to gather and work through 
the "R for Data Science" text in a collaborative and supportive environment. The
creation of this group was inspired by my own success in transitioning to a 
career in data science coupled with the resources that I wanted to see in the R 
programming space. This talk will go through the learnings of creating an online
learning space focused on R programming for data science, and how future 
iterations of similar groups can more proactively center on bringing about 
diversity, equity, and inclusion to data science spaces.
