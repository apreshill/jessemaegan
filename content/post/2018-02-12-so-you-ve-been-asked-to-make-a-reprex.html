<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you’ve found yourself here, you’ve probably been asked to create a <strong>re</strong>producible <strong>ex</strong>ample, or <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help/">reprex</a>, in response to a question you asked on <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">community.rstudio.com</a>). This post will do a cursory overview of both creating a reprex as well as how to <em>share</em> your reprex on the RStudio Community site.</p>

<div id="a-brief-reprex-how-to" class="section level2">
<h2>A brief reprex “how to”</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install and load the <code>reprex</code> package</li>
<li>Highlight the code <strong>and associated packages, indicated by <code>library(package_name)</code></strong>, like so: <img src="highlighted_reprex_code.png" alt="Highlighted code and package used to create a reprex" /></li>
<li>Copy the highlighted code by pressing Ctrl + Enter/Cmd + Enter</li>
<li>In the <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html">console</a> type <code>reprex()</code> and hit Enter/Return</li>
<li>Everything that you need to post a reprex is now automatically stored on your clipboard!</li>

<h3>If you haven’t created your post yet</h3>
<p>Remember that as soon as you run reprex() in the console, everything you need to share your reprex has been stored on your clipboard, and you do not need to take any additional steps to getting a reprex ready!</p>
<p>Navigate to community.rstudio.com and create a new post. Paste (Ctrl + v/Cmd + v) your reprex into the posting box on the left and add any necessary commentary to help community members answer your question, like so: <img src="ggplot2_reprex_image.png" alt="Example reprex post using a ggplot2 example" /></p>
