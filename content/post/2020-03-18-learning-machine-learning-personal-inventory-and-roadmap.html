<div id="have-you-ever-played-civ" class="section level2">
<h2>Have you ever played Civ?</h2>
<!-- show, don't tell -->
<p>Like most video games, I’d heard everyone rave about Civ, but had no idea what was involved in the gameplay. The first Civ game that I played? I quit within the first 15 minutes because – wait for it – I thought the map was broken. I didn’t play another Civ game for over three years, until all of a sudden I realize i’s 2:36AM and I’m bleary-eyed, wiping the crumbs off my desk, and swearing “just one more turn.”</p>
</div>
<div id="civ-map-learning-map" class="section level2">
<h2>Civ Map &lt;&gt; Learning Map</h2>
<p>What I didn’t realize at the time was that with each turn you play in Civ, you begin to progressively uncover more and more of the map, until you’ve uncovered everything, and can get a full lay of the land. To me there’s no greater metaphor for your personal learning journey than uncovering the map in Civ. So many of us set out to become “data scientists” or “machine learning engineers” because they seem like <em>really cool things to do</em> (and they are). And while there might be some general landmarks (folks recommending this book or this class), no one knows your personal learning map - it’s something that you have to uncover as you go.</p>
<p>But like Civ, you have to pick a direction (or two) and go. <!-- no, spell this out better - show, don't tell --> You can’t spend the first 150 turns building Scouts just to uncover the map (I mean you <em>can</em> - but I’d argue you’re wasting precious time and resources, and leaving yourself very vulnerable to attack.)</p>
</div>
<div id="my-learning-map-general-landmarks" class="section level2">
<h2>My Learning Map: general landmarks</h2>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time uncovering my map. Like, a <em>lot</em> of time. Something about management – wanting to develop more technical skills, but never <em>needing</em> to develop technical skills Kaggle + personal interests led to general landmarks: - Deep Learning (why: machine-learning//deep-learning generated art &amp; music) - Magenta//NSynth - ???</p>
</div>
<div id="my-learning-map-navigation" class="section level2">
<h2>My Learning Map: navigation</h2>
<p>Even if you have your general landmarks, no one necessarily knows the best way for you to reach them. This is why you see so many forum posts about things like “R or Python?” “PyTorch or TensorFlow?” What do I need <em>right now</em> vs what will be nice to have <em>in the future</em>?</p>
