<p>At my first data science job I worked with a guy who would throw his hands up and shout “We did it, Reddit!” any time something went really well.
And last night was a <em>huge</em> “We did it, Reddit!” moment for me, and I hope for many of you as well.</p>
<p>My goal with streaming #TidyTuesday Unfiltered is to show what it’s like to work with an unfamiliar dataset, make mistakes in front of others, learn on the fly, and build a sense of community while also creating beginner-friendly content. You can check out the inaugural stream <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1034279289">here</a>.</p>
<p>Looking to skip past the 90 minutes of cats and conversation and dive right into creating our boxplot?
I’ve got you covered.
Here’s a 10-minute video walking through the code:</p>

<p>And the code!</p>
<pre><code># setup
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)

# data import
tuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(&#39;2021-05-25&#39;)
records &lt;- tuesdata$records

# initial exploration of dataset
glimpse(records)

records %&gt;% 
  skim()

records_tt &lt;- records %&gt;% 
  mutate(track = factor(track))
glimpse(records_tt)

# let&#39;s create a boxplor
records_tt %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = track, y = record_duration)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# add alpha 0.6 to geom_boxplot, swap x and y variables
records_tt %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = record_duration, y = track)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6)

# add a fill, where fill = type in aes() so we can see single vs triple laps
records_tt %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = record_duration, y = track, fill = type)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6)

# print a .png version of the graph

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#TidyTuesday project</a> is a weekly data visualization challenge that asks community members to take a dataset, tidy it as needed, and create code and visualizations to share on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidyTuesday&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter</a>. The visualizations are <em>phenomenal</em> and well worth perusing each week.</p>
