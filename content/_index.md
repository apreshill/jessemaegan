description: Hello and welcome! Inside you'll find many of my projects. While I have historically focused on content aimed at helping beginners get started with data science using R, going forward the scope of this site will be expanding. Over time I'll be including more data science and machine learning content using both R and Python (still aimed at beginners!) as well as breakdowns on the #TidyTuesday soir√©e. But I'll also be bringing you along on my foray into the animation program at RISD as well as how I'm using animation to bring programming, data science, and machine learning concepts to life.
